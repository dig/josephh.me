            <h3>Week 1 - Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We got given a virtual machine hosted by the university which can be accessed at 
                <a href="https://uop-1-server-per-student-prod.appspot.com/instance/get">https://uop-1-server-per-student-prod.appspot.com/instance/get</a>, 
                I can now use a SSH client such as putty or termius (for mac) to connect into the VM and start controlling it.
              </li>
              <li>We also got access to the draft coursework so we can start preparing for that.</li>
              <li>I already use and had visual studio code installed before coming to the university so I kept on using the editor that I was used to however we were told alternatives such as Atom, Notepad++ & Sublime Text which at some point I should check out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 2 – Web Security</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week we looked into information & social engineering, we started by listing all our personal information we generate on a daily basis. We then went on to find out how our information was being processed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 3 – Reviewing Literature</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Since our coursework was due soon, this week we learnt about reviewing literature at university level. I learnt that a literature review should be unbiased, objective and reliable information. The type of papers we should read were academic journals, books and online documents.</li>
              <li>When we are selecting papers for our writeup, we should skim read papers those topics are similar to the topic we are writing about. Once we are happy with the content of each paper, fully read it and take down structured notes.</li>
              <li>The main layout of the writeup was introduction, themes, conclusion then reference list.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 4 – Academic Writing</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week was about improving our writing to suit the university writing standards.</li>
              <li>Our writing needed to be evidence based, evaluative, thoughtful, logical, neutral and structured which was explained in depth during the lecture.</li>
              <li>We needed to avoid personal opinions, overuse of brackets and exclaiming.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 5 – Introduction to Markup</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week we were introduced to the markup language HTML. This is the template HTML we used to start our first HTML file.</li>
              <li>After creating our index.html file, we uploaded it to our VM by using an FTP client such as FileZilla using the SFTP protocol. We then started a http server on the VM by typing http-server which creates a development server on port 8080 of the VM’s external IP address.</li>
              <li>After playing around with the basic HTML elements, I went to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">https://www.w3schools.com</a> and went through all the different HTML elements to refresh my memory since I have previous experience with web development prior to university.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 7 – Separating Form and Content</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The lecture and lab this week were focused towards style. This is an important topic because style is the main part of frontend website development.</li>
              <li>We learnt about cascading style sheets (CSS) and that we can use the HTML link tag to include our external CSS files into the HTML document.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 8 – Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week we were introduced to different techniques that can make us more efficient while we create our websites.</li>
              <li>We started to look at all the different packages made for our editors.</li>
              
              <li>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Live HTML Preview:</b> Allows us to see our changes to the HTML file on the fly, it automatically refreshes the HTML file as we make changes and allows a live preview.</li>
                  <li><b>Multi Cursor:</b> Allows us to select multiple parts of the document at the same time, this can save us time by allowing us to mass replace fast.</li>
                  <li><b>Linter:</b> This analyses our code and flags any errors to us.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Another method of being more productive was to setup a WinSCP folder sync so whenever we make changes locally it would upload the edited file to our VM automatically and deploy on our development http server. This allows for rapid testing and prevents us from dragging and dropping into a FTP client every time we make a change.</li>
              
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 9 – Design</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week we were introduced to design techniques that websites use.</li>
              <li>Every website you create, should start off with a design on a program such as photoshop or paint.</li>
              <li>A common design pattern is called the MVC pattern means model, view, controller.</li>

              <li>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Model:</b> Data structure, could be a database or file.</li>
                  <li><b>View:</b> The display part of the pattern, this is usually the HTML and other client sided applications such as JavaScript.</li>
                  <li><b>Controller:</b> Updates the models and views, it’s the backend of the website.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 10 – Using Images</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week we were introduced to using the image html tag, this allows us to display images in our html document.</li>
              <li>I learnt that we can also use the picture tag to display different image types depending if the browser supports it or not.</li>
              <li>We can also attach a link to the image by using the anchor tag wrapped around the image tag.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 11 & 12 – Christmas Break</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>N/A</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 13 – Addressing the Web</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week was all around linking and URLs on the web, we found that html documents can be navigated through links/anchor tag on pages.</li>
              <li>Example: http://192.168.0.1:8080/index.php</li>

              <li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Scheme: The scheme indicates what format in which the request should be sent, some examples are https, ftp, http, mailto.</li>
                  <li>Domain/Host: This part can either be a domain name (e.g google.com) or an IP such as IPv4 or IPv6. Every computer on the internet has a unique identifier known as the IP. Domains are translated to IP through a DNS resolver (e.g 1.1.1.1 or google’s 8.8.8.8).</li>
                  <li>Port: This part is known as the port, computers run services on network ports and allows you choose which service on that host you would like to access. HTTP runs on port 80, HTTPS runs on 443.</li>
                  <li>File: This part tells the server what you would like to access, index.php is used as the default file for PHP webservers.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 14 – Website Marking Scheme</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week was all about validating our websites using the W3 validator, you attach the W3 validator link as an anchor tag on your site and you can click it to see any errors or warnings about your HTML mark-up.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 15 – Standards</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week was about internet standards, ISO for international organization for standardization which is the org that deals with setting and updating standards.</li>
              <li>HTTP, HTML, TCP/IP are all standards but just for different purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Week 16 – Usability</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>This week we learnt how important usability is for all people, every user should gain the same experience and information from your website.</li>
              
              <li>General guidelines
                <ul>
                  <li>Handle errors gracefully.</li>
                  <li>If the system is busy, tell the user.</li>
                  <li>Use consistent terms.</li>
                  <li>Follow industry standards.</li>
                  <li>Always consider needs of your user.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              

              <li>Usability mistakes
                <ul>
                  <li>Neglecting user aims.</li>
                  <li>Neglecting mobile users.</li>
                  <li>Inconsistent design.</li>
                  <li>Ignoring design standards/conventions.</li>
                  <li>Old content.</li>
                  <li>No search functions.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
