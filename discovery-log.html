                I can now use a SSH client such as putty or termius (for mac) to connect into the VM and start controlling it.

              <li>We also got access to the draft coursework so we can start preparing for that.</li>
              <li>I already use and had visual studio code installed before coming to the university so I kept on using the editor that I was used to however we were told alternatives such as Atom, Notepad++ & Sublime Text which at some point I should check out.</li>
