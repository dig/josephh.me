              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>Recent years we have seen a meteoric rise for personal information exposure on the web by different forms of 
               communication systems, such as social media <cite>(Patil & Kapadia, 2012)</cite>. Throughout this review, we will be exploring 
                the different ways that personal information can get exposed and the methods of lowering the exposure so that you 
                can stay safe while using the web. We will be reviewing the exposure on social media, database breaches, malicious 
                websites and android applications.</p>
              
              <h3>Social Media</h3>
              <p>Social media websites have been on the rise and contain a vast amount of information about its users. 
                Since it’s similar to in-person interactions, users are willing to expose more of their personal information 
                because they see others are doing the same and they don’t see any fear <cite>(Lucas & Borisov, 2008)</cite>. Low amounts of 
                fear diminish the safety because the threat is not seen as important enough to address <cite>(LaRose, Rifon, & Enbody, 
                2008)</cite>. The users of social media need fear in order to think about making their information private otherwise they 
                won’t see what could happen if they made their information public.</p>

              <p>Social media websites allow users to manage their privacy settings by selecting which preferences for various 
                controls <cite>(Patil & Kapadia, 2012)</cite> however these controls are limited and do not give the user power to fully 
                control their privacy settings. Users need to have complete control of their security controls and privacy 
                settings so they can understand privacy and control over what personal information is public or private 
                <cite>(Karat, Brodie, & Karat, 2006)</cite>. When you originally sign up to a social media website, the user does not 
                immediately configure their settings which led to the social media company having complete control of the 
                default settings for each user. Default configuration could include privacy settings being at a low standard 
                therefore personal information exposure being at its highest. This can be prevented by configuring your account’s
                 privacy settings soon as you register.</p>

              <p>With the expansion of social media, there are solutions to keeping your personal information to the correct parties
                 and not exposed to the public or even a hacker. A solution that Facebook users can use to encrypt their data when 
                 it is sent to the servers is called “flyByNight”. A simple and lightweight application to encrypt and decrypt 
                 sensitive data using JavaScript, this application ensures your data is not sent in an unencrypted form to the 
                 Facebook servers <cite>(Lucas & Borisov, 2008)</cite>.</p>
              
              <h3>Database Breach</h3>
              <p>Hackers and criminals started to increase attacks on databases and information systems in public companies which 
                contain sensitive information about its users <cite>(Kwok, Lai, & Yeung, 2009)</cite>. Majority of the users on the web reuse the 
                same password for every website they create an account for, this is known as “password sharing”. Password sharing puts 
                trust in every website you sign up for because what would happen if one website got breached? Your commonly used password 
                would be public information. The methods of mitigating such as use of a password manager, will allow you to 
                generate a randomly created password at any length and store it for future use.</p>
              
              <h3>Malicious Websites</h3>
              <p>Websites can be used by attackers to deliver malicious content or to host a phishing website designed to steal 
                personal information from its victims. Unfortunately, most of the victims have very little security background 
                so they are unable to detect this kind of scam <cite>(Canali, Balzarotti, & Francillon, 2013)</cite>. A phishing website is a 
                site which has been made to look like another website in an attempt to gather personal information such as passwords 
                from users who think the website is real. Users will attempt to login on the fake website and this website would 
                have been made to gather the data in a format for the hackers to use at a later date. This can be prevented and 
                lessen the exposure of personal information by verifying every website you navigate to. This includes checking if 
                the URL is correct and ensure that the green padlock known as HTTPS is shown next to the URL bar.</p>
              
              <h3>Android Applications</h3>
              <p>The application market on mobile phones has risen in the last couple years which led to an expansion of security 
                exploits and breaches. Businesses could take advantage of these applications to gather information about their 
                users such as GPS location, photos, calendar, contacts and email. This could be used for their own advantage 
                or unauthorized access could lead to sensitive data being at serious security risks. We can prevent this from 
                happening by correctly setting the permissions per application so that it only has access to the information it 
                requires. For example, a gaming application having access to your contacts, this type of application does not need 
                access to our contacts. We can mitigate the information exposure on android applications by educating the users. 
                Ensure the user knows that they should only download applications from the official Android Market and not jail 
                breaking the device <cite>(Wei, Gomez, Neamtiu, & Faloutsos, 2012)</cite>. Informing that the user knows about application 
                permissions, how to grant permissions and how to revoke permissions from a certain application. All of this can 
                mostly be found in the phone general settings.</p>
              
              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>We have outlined how personal information can get exposed on the web and the methods of mitigating the 
                information. All these findings have confirmed that mitigating personal information on the web can be a 
                tough task and definitely requires a privacy background in order to detect the ways your information could 
                get exposed. If you are not aware of the risks and fears of having all your information public, you will not 
                be cautious of your online information.</p>
